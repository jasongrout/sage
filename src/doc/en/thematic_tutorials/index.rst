Welcome to the Sage Thematic Tutorials!
=======================================

This is an index, grouped by theme, of Sage demonstrations, quick
reference cards, primers, and thematic tutorials, licensed under
a `Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/>`_.

.. To be reinstated once we have some of them in the Sage sources!
.. - A *demonstration* is a short document giving a broad view of the
..   available features on a given theme; it is typically presented
..   during a talk, and lasts a couple minutes.

- A *quickref* (or quick reference card) is a one page document with
  the essential examples, and pointers to the main entry points.

- A *primer* is a document meant for a user to get started by himself
  on a theme in a matter of minutes.

- A *tutorial* is more in-depth and could take as much as an hour or
  more to get through.

Some of those tutorials are part of a series developed for the MAA
PREP Workshop `Sage: Using Open-Source Mathematics Software with
Undergraduates <../prep/index.html>`_.
